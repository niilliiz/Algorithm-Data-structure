## Merge Sort

### Time Complexity
Time Complexity
All Cases: O(n²)
- Best Case: `O(n)` - Happens when the array is already sorted
- Average Case: `O(n²)` - Random distribution of elements
- Worst Case: `O(n²)` - Happens when the array is sorted in reverse order



### Space Complexity
- `O(1)` - Constant Space
